2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net btn_IBUF[1] is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): btn_IBUF[1]_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#2 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net btn_IBUF[2] is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): btn_IBUF[2]_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#3 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net sw_IBUF[0] is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): sw_IBUF[0]_inst/O
Related violations: <none>
